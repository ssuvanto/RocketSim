# RocketSim
This is a fairly simple rocket simulator I made a few years ago. It simulates a Falcon 9 rocket launching into a low earth orbit.
It currently uses an RK4 integrator although a Velocity Verlet version is commented out.

You can find a runnable executable somewhere in the RocketSim/bin folder.

I may or may not (probably not) work on this anymore as I haven't touched it in many years but it's pretty nice to look at as it is.
